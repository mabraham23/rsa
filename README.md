# rsa

Implmentation of RSA algorithm which correclty encrypts and decrypts messages sent from one user to another. It does this using public and private keys.
Creating RSA, I learned about internet security, how RSA utilizes mathematical factoring complexity to ensure security and time complexity of algorithms.
